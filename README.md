# WIX TO MONDAY FETCH
A (very) simple POST to Monday [www.monday.com]((monday.com)) from Wix using 'monday-sdk-js'. This example was used for a client that needed an email added with a label of "Incomplete" and send the client to an external website to complete registration. So that's basically what it does.

Attach this code to the submit button, change the function to whatever the 'click' name is ('register_click' in this case), and make sure that the correct input name (#formEmail or whatever) is being used for the email or whatever other data you're trying to send.

I don't know too much else or care too much else about this at the moment so if it doesn't work, I can probably help you debug it if you hmu on IG and you alreadt asked ChatGPT and it didn't want to help you... otherwise you may be on your own on this one. All I know is it worked whenever I used it for that purpose. It's just been sitting in my files for a while and I thought maybe someone else might get use out of it.
