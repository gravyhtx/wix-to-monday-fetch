# WIX TO MONDAY FETCH
A (very) simple POST to Monday ([monday.com](monday.com)) from Wix using 'monday-sdk-js'. This example was used for a client that needed an email added with a label of "Incomplete" and send the client to an external website to complete registration. So that's basically what it does.

Attach this code to the submit button and make sure that the correct input ID is being used for the email (or whatever other data you're trying to send).
